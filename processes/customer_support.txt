> **Task:** Generate a *single* conversational **customer-support case** as JSON.
>
> ### A. Clustering criterion
>
> Inspect the *content* of all messages and assign the case to **one** of these clusters (write the value into the "cluster" key):
>
> | Cluster value                                                           | Trigger keywords / ideas (match case-insensitive) |
> | ----------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------- |
> | **Refund**                                                              | refund, return, money back, exchange      |
> | **Delivery Delay**                                                      | delay, late, shipping, tracking           |
> | **Product Defect**                                                      | broken, defect, damage, faulty, scratch |
> | Choose the first matching cluster; if none match, default to **Other**. |                                                   |

> ### C. Context-specific activities
>
> For **every** event add a "contextual_activity" that starts with the value of "activity" and appends the **sentiment** (derived from the message) in parentheses:
>
> * *positive* → “(Positive)”
> * *neutral*  → “(Neutral)”
> * *negative* → “(Negative)”
>   Example: Customer Reply (Negative)
>
> ### D. Output format
>
> Return exactly one JSON object with:
>
> * **cluster**: *string* – one of Refund, Delivery Delay, Product Defect, Other
> * **events**: *array* of objects **in strictly increasing timestamp order**. Each event has:
>
>   * **activity**: *one of the 15 activities above*
>   * **timestamp**: *ISO 8601 full date-time with Z-suffix* (e.g. "2025-07-31T08:15:30Z")
>   * **contextual\_activity**: *string* (must start with activity)
>   * **message**: *string, at least 50 characters*
