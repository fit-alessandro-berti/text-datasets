Please generate:

1) a prompt asking an LLM to generate a case for a process involving textual messages/communications.
2) the process should have a criteria used to split the cases, mainly thanks to the content of the text messages. This criteria can be used to cluster the cases.
3) more than an activity should be context-dependent. So, there should be a general-purpose name of the activity, plus the context-specific name of the activity. As an example, in a ticketing process, the "Ticket Closed" can be the general-purpose, and "Ticket Closed (Customer Dissatisfied)" the context-specific name.
4) Define clearly for the LLM which are the general-purpose activities, context-specific activities, and criteria for the clustering.
5) Ask the LLM to produce a JSON (the "case") containing a "cluster" key, and a "events" key associated to a list of events. Each event has an "activity", a "timestamp" (increasing), a "contextual_activity", and a "message" (textual, >= 50 characters). The contextual activity should depend on the sentiment of the message. The contextual activity should start with the "activity".

Feel free to decide the process. Make sure there are 10-15 different activities.
Please provide also a JSON validation schema for the validation of the returned cases.
